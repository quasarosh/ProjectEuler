# ProjectEuler

This project has my JAVA solutions for the problems in ProjectEuler.net website. 

Please note that each Java file has a main method, which can be used as a tester of the solution. Most of the solutions have a dependency files, such as Enum file or Java files in utils directory. Also, most of the Java file has been tested with the unit tests located in '/test/projecteuler/' directory.
